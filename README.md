# rcso-homepage

The source code for my homepage I wrote for my Sheriff's Office on a community called East County Roleplay. A community ran by absolute morons and self righteous pricks, who only believe in themselves and what they think is best for them - not the community.

They had the audacity to change the credits on there to `ECRP` when it was originally `devlexander` on the homepage, with a link to my GitHub profile. This is the original source code, with the correct credits. A preview can be found here: https://infin1tyy.github.io/rcso-homepage/ , or if you want to see the pirated copy: http://so.eastcountyrp.com

Use this at your own free will! The more people that use it, the better. I want you all to spread the word about the backstabbing, hurtfully using community managers that this community has.
